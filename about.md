### Currently

<img src="/assets/picture-of-me.jpg" alt="Matthew Duff" width="600"/>

I live in Denver, CO. I am married to the imitable [Kylee Duff](https://www.instagram.com/kyleeduff). We have four children and two pups. I really like to üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and play üèÄ. I love eating at great fast casual restaurants.

I work at [GitHub](https://github.com) as the Director of Communities of Practice and Advanced Security in the Professional Services department. I worked at [MX](https://mx.com) before that.

My largest interests outside of work are:

- deliberate eating (trying to get better at this)
- **Liveable cities:** Primarily focused on better transportation options, removing zoning restrictions, and make more walkable/bikeable cities. Check out my [Twitter account for better Littleton streets](https://www.twitter.com/littleton4bikes)
- **House design:** Check out my [Youtube channel about building a Passive House](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD1rs6e3tx6r2dd1QWfiN2g)

### What childhood colors this perspective?

I grew up in rural Poland Spring, Maine. Our family moved there from Boston, Massachusetts when I was starting kindergarten. We lived on a dead end road that we made through the woods, Duff Road. It was a town of poverty, without much precedence or hope for a way out. There were many incredible people in the town, but the area could really trap people. I've lived in the Rocky Mountain Region since graduating high school.
