title: "Wealth inequality: There will always be differences. Let's create a floor, and maybe a ceiling."

### Some text to test

- add image

### We cannot remove differences and wealth, and in the middle we shouldn't even try

- People spend money differently because we value different things. 
- If we gave 10 people lump sums each month they would hoard, spend, or give that money to wildly different levels. And that isn't a bad thing. 

### We can likely find common ground

- People from different backgrounds have different goals (The Righteous Mind)
- But we can likely align on a floor, even if our reasons for having this floor are different
- Equality of opportunity, both because we value equity, but also because we need these people to help us make our communities, cities, states, country, and world better. 

### Foundations

Our goals should be to enable every person to have access to:

- Clean air
- Clean water
- Food
- Shelter (even if very small)
- Safety
- Medical care access (mental, physical, of course dental)
- Education
  - What do we do about equality here? People can be funded the same at a federal and state level, but wealthy communities can always come in and provide more resources. Should we try to prevent that? I am not sure. 
  - We should look at foundations here as well. I love the sentiment and motivations behind free college for all, but I don't think our current education system is worth investing in at this level. We should consider ensuring everyone has the needed training to thrive an important objective, but it feels like we are throwing money at a less effective system.
