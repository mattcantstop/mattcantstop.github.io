# Join Spoonme.kitchen to help us build our iOS app

`TL;DR:` After about 6 months of building our web app and getting user feedback we are ready to start development to launch our mobile app. We are looking for an iOS engineer to join us for up to 25 hours/week (could be more in the initial weeks) at $100/hour. Candidates can live anywhere in the world.

### About Spoon

Spoonme enables people to track their nutrition, share the food with the people they love, and effortlessly discover great new meals to make. We have built a very strong, flexible nutrition tracker and now we are releasing social features to share the food you love. We want to make an app that celebrates food, community, and our cultures. There are many food tracking apps on the marketplace, but our niche will be very different than competitors. Our focus is food discovery and making food social, with great nutrition tracking capabilities. Many companies are venture funded despite the business model not necessitating it. Spoonme is an attempt to see if we can make a consumer app people love, provide our unique perspective on what the best experience would look like, and take on larger companies while making a profitable company. 

### About the role

We have worked with some designers to think through the application flow, feature sets, and design. Those mobile designs will be finalized in the next couple of weeks. We are looking for an iOS engineer to work with us on building a SwiftUI application. You will be given a detailed set of documents to build the app from, with much of the brainstorming having already been done (although your perspective is welcome!). We want to ship features quickly, and roll them out iteratively, over the coming months.

### About you

We are looking for a kind, empathetic human who is self-driven and curious. We are a small team and we need team members to work with us who can move quickly and ship significant features. Larger teams need a diverse set of people who can ship features quickly, and team members who can polish something and foresee potential issues years in the future. For our current stage of the company and our current size, our team needs someone who can ship quickly to get the product in users' hands so we can receive feedback. We are looking for prolific team members who love to ship.

### Compensation and company structure

We have a unique working setup at Spoonme. We only work 25 hours per week. We want to have a balance between work and life. We have one scheduled meeting per week where we align on what we have shipped in the previous week, discuss any new context that informs our path forward, and discuss our next steps. We believe that consistent effort, over the long term, can create an incredibly useful product and a fantastic company. This role will pay $100/hour. We have a [similar approach to Gumroad](https://sahillavingia.com/work), where nobody is an employee, and everyone works for an hourly wage to keep the company small and provide flexibility for employees. Some of our team members are building their own thing during their other time. That's great with us!

### How to apply

Send me an email at `matt` at `peakstreak` dot co. Please include some links to apps you have built that you are proud of. Let me know your familiarity level with Swift and mobile development. A link to your portfolio or personal website is helpful. Some people hire based on company names or degrees. I do not. I hire based on your ability to demonstrate strong knowledge, ability, and tendency to ship software. Last time I opened up a role I had about 60 qualified people apply. Please keep this in mind. 

#### The interview process (to be transparent):

- Send application in (4 are selected from this stage)
- Interview (2 move on)
- Paid technical work (one is selected after this)
- Get started

This is an imperfect way to evaluate candidates, but after having hired over 100 people in my career, it works as well as any of the other methods! I look forward to reading your email and am excited to get started building together!
