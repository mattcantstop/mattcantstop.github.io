### Writing has serious benefits

Other than in my day job, I don't write much. I wrote all the time in college. I also participated heavily in social networks from about 2006 - 2018. I wrote often, put my opinions out on the internet, and as a result of feedback changed many views I had. Sharing my thoughts in the forum of public opinion, and hearing _really good_ rebuttals to my views, changed me for the better.

I am going to write more again. My writings will likely revolve around a few topics:

- philosophical ideas
- my quest to eat deliberately
- bicycles, cities, sustainable housing, and general "how do we build the infrastructure of human existence?"
